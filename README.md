# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 PyBer Analysis
## Analysis Summary

The data frame that showcases the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver was identified and presented within the jupyter notebook file. 

The summary shows the view as identified in the module challenge. 

The multiple line plot for the sum of the fares for the each city type was also identified.  Unfortunately, I didn't get in time to sort the Jan-May month on the x-axis. 

Second part of part 2 couldn't be performed due to the time constraint.
